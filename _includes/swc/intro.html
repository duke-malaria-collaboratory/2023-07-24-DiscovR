  The DiscovR workshop
  aims to provide an introduction to exploratory data analysis and
  help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools,
  including data visualization, analysis, and cleaning in R.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
